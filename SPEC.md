  <name>ðŸŽ¬ Oscars Party Game â€“ Jackbox-Style Multiplayer Predictions ðŸŽ‰</name>

  <overview>
    You are an expert full-stack web developer tasked with creating an interactive, real-time multiplayer Oscars prediction game. The game should resemble the seamless lobby-based multiplayer experience found in Jackbox party games. Players will join effortlessly via a unique four-letter code and compete by predicting Oscar winners live during the event. Real-time score updates, leaderboards, and mobile-first usability are essential.

    - Next.js 15 with the App Router for server-side rendering and API handling
    - TypeScript for robust type-safety and maintainability
    - Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI development
    - Shadcn UI components
    - Supabase Realtime for real-time data synchronization
    - Vercel Edge Functions for low-latency backend interactions
    - Optional: Zustand or SWR for efficient state management on client-side

        - Host-controlled bonus rounds or surprise questions for extra points

    </core_features>

    <technical_features>
      - Strong security practices to ensure game integrity
      - Efficient real-time data handling via WebSockets (Supabase Realtime or equivalent)
      - Easy deployment and scalability on Vercel
      - Modular, maintainable TypeScript codebase following best practices

  </requirements>

  <prompt_instructions>
    - First, clearly outline your approach, including:
      1. Project file structure and initial setup steps
      2. How you'll generate/manage unique lobby codes
      3. Real-time connection and synchronization logic
      4. UI components and routing logic in Next.js (app router)

    - After outlining the approach clearly, systematically build the codebase:
      - Set up Next.js 15 application with required dependencies
      - Implement lobby creation and player join logic
      - Implement real-time WebSocket synchronization
      - Build the prediction ballot interface with mobile-first UX
      - Develop real-time scoring backend and leaderboard frontend
      - Ensure styling with Tailwind CSS matches an Oscars/Hollywood aesthetic

    - Regularly explain reasoning and important implementation details. Confirm with me before executing major steps (e.g., installing dependencies, creating new files, running scripts).

    - Keep the code clean, modular, and thoroughly commented for easy review and maintainability.
    
    - After completing the core features, provide guidance on deployment to Vercel and handling scaling for potentially many concurrent users.

    - Provide a final README.md clearly documenting how to run, host, and manage the Oscars game.
